# Keep up-to-date
New SDKs have amazing coverage - or at least they should. You’ve worked hard to accurately implement every endpoint and model so your SDK is a complete solution for developers. The big problem is that drift occurs over time.

SDKs are how developers utilize your APIs, so updating them in a timely manner should be prioritized along with documentation. Coordinating SDK updates, tests and releases in multiple languages can be challenging. The belief that SDKs updates can wait may creep into your company's thinking. To avoid this, establish SDK updates as part of your API development pipeline.

Even when your API doesn’t change, you may need to update your SDKs. A 3rd party library you include in your SDK will have security updates of their own. Keep your developers secure by establishing an ad hoc process for releasing individual SDKs.

Deprecated functionality should be treated with the same urgency as new functionality. Developers shouldn’t be frustrated with broken functionality in your SDK due to deprecation plans that don’t include SDKs.
