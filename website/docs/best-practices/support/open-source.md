# Open Source
You should consider open sourcing your SDKs on GitHub. It’s very popular with companies who provide SDKs to their developers. In addition to your SDKs, you can collect the code from a getting started or use case guide and make it available to developers via GitHub.

## ReadMe
Developers may go directly to GitHub looking for your SDK instead of your developer portal. Have a well written README that includes a condensed version of your getting started guide and links to other documentation like the SDK reference.

## Issues
I would argue that GitHub issues are a great reason to share your SDK codebase. Developers using your SDK want an easy way to tell you about problems they encounter and suggest ways to make your SDK better. Conversations about your SDK with the developer community is captured in one place for your engineers to reference.

## Contributions
You’ll want to define how contributions will be handled. This is a best practice for open source projects. It’s especially important if you are generating some or all of your code. External pull requests may not be possible if generated files are modified. This doesn’t mean you can’t accept PRs, but you should be transparent about the situation so developers don’t spend a lot of time crafting a pull request you won’t be able to merge. These are [Xero’s contributing guidelines](https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) around pull requests.
