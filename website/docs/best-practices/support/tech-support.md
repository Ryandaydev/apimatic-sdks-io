# Tech Support
SDKs will influence the types of questions your support team receives. Code  libraries, documentation, guides and code samples provide developers a self service onboarding option. Your support team will spend less time answering questions about authentication and more helping developers solve their unique business problems. If developers run into problems using your SDK, the support team can recreate the issue using your SDK and propose a fix or submit a bug report to your engineering team.
