# Generate Documentation

In addition to API reference docs, developers expect documentation specific to your SDK.  

Letâ€™s compare different [templates for generating documentation](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators#documentation-generators) with OpenAPI generator.


|   | dynamic html | html | html2 | markdown |
| ------ :| :------ :|  :------ :|  :------ :| :------ :| 
| Explain methods and params | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸŸ¢  | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸŸ¢ |
| Models and properties | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸŸ¢ |
| Enums allowed values | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸŸ¢  | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸ”´ |
| Display base url | ğŸŸ¢ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸŸ¢ |
| Response headers | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸŸ¡  | ğŸ”´ |
| Example JSON response | ğŸ”´ | ğŸŸ¡ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ |
| Runnable code sample | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸŸ¡ | ğŸ”´ |
| How authentication works | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ | ğŸ”´ |

|   | Legend  |
| :------ :| :------ | 
| ğŸŸ¢ | Good | 
| ğŸŸ¡ | Incomplete | 
| ğŸ”´ | Missing | 

Try it yourself, by running this command in your terminal

``` bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli:v6.2.1 generate \
    -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apimatic/petstore/main/oas/petstore.yaml \
    -g html2 \
    -o /local/html2
```

HTML2 is the most visually appealing template and attempts to generate runnable code, but sadly misses the mark.  For example, the create pets method expects a native Pet object, but instead a JSON string is provided. For strongly typed languages, the syntax is invalid.  This pattern is repeated across all languages.

Donâ€™t despair, you can clone the OpenAPI generator repository and modify the mustache templates to address many of these shortcomings. I will say that generating runnable code snippets in multiple languages was a sizable challenging and at Xero we ended up adding complex vendor extensions to achieve it. Check out [Xeroâ€™s SDK documentation](https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-node/accounting/index.html).
