The complete code for our sample app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/apimatic/petstore/tree/main/typescript/apimatic).

## Tips for building a sample app

### Configure local dependency
Typically we run a command like `npm install [x]` to add dependicies to a project. Since we haven't published our SDK to a package manager (npm), we need to point to our local copy. 

Determine the relative path to your local generated SDK and add it to package.json.

```
"petstorelib":  "file:../Petstore"
```

Your package.json will look something like this.

``` json
{
  "name": "apimatic-sample-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "petstorelib": "file:../Petstore"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

### Install dependencies

With your petstore dependency sorted, you can install it with the command.

``` bash
npm install
```

### Get list of pets

Go to the Petstore developer portal you generated and click on **List Pets**

Click **Configure**, then check **Show Complete File** and enter **1234** for the access token.  

![Configure code](/img/apimatic-configure-code.png)

Close the configure screen. The code sample can be copy/pasted into your app and is fully runnable.

I've added a console.log() so there is something to see in our terminal.

The final code looks like this.

``` typescript

import { ApiError, Client, PetsController } from 'petstorelib';

const client = new Client({
  timeout: 0,
  accessToken: '1234',
});

const petsController = new PetsController(client);
const limit = 10;

try {
  const { result, ...httpResponse } = await petsController.listPets(limit);
  // Get more response info...
  // const { statusCode, headers } = httpResponse;
  if(result?.length) {  
    console.log('Hello ' + result[0].name);
  }
} catch(error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    const errors = error.result;
    // const { statusCode, headers } = error;
  }
}
```

Next, compile your Typescript to JavaScript.

``` bash
tsc --build
```

Run the code.

``` bash
node index.js
```

This should display "Hello X" in the terminal. (X is randomly generated by our mock API server.)

Let's look at customizing generated documentation with APIMatic.
