# Introduction

APIMatic is a DX Platform used by API companies to generate SDKs and documentation from API specifications. They have a suite of features to support developer through the API journey.

* Authentication assistance
> APIMatic SDKs have built-in support for popular OAuth flows that provide helper methods to generate access tokens and append them with each API request.

* Autogenerate SDKs and code samples
> SDKs with excellent code samples are the fastest way to integrate APIs. APIMatic autogenerates SDKs and idiomatic, production-ready code that developers can cut and paste directly into their codebase.

* Language-specific docs and get-started guides
> Remove the time to get started with your API. APIMatic will generate comprehensive documentation covering setting up an environment and how-to guides.

* API Code Playground
> Developers can interact with your API through a code playground to create code in their language of choice and see if the code produces their desired results.

* Publish your developer portal anywhere
> Host language-specific documentation and SDKs on one domain where developers can experience your API or embed alongside existing documentation in your developer portal.

* Automate via CI/CD and CLI
> With full CI/CD integration across the API ecosystem, creating and maintaining a great DX is easier with continuous code generation. Any updates and changes will be published in seconds.
