# Introduction

APIMatic is a developer experience platform used by API companies to generate SDKs and documentation from API specifications. While working on his PhD thesis at University of Ackland, the founder Adeel Ali recognized the potential of generating client SDKs from API specifications. He started APIMatic as a way to help companies deliver experiences which lead to higher API adoption.

APIMatic has a suite of features to support developers through the API journey.

* Authentication assistance
> APIMatic SDKs have built-in support for popular OAuth flows that provide helper methods to generate access tokens and append them with each API request.

* Autogenerate SDKs and code samples
> SDKs with excellent code samples are the fastest way to integrate APIs. APIMatic autogenerates SDKs and idiomatic, production-ready code that developers can cut and paste directly into their codebase.

* Language-specific docs and get-started guides
> Remove the time to get started with your API. APIMatic will generate comprehensive documentation covering setting up an environment and how-to guides.

* API Code Playground
> Developers can interact with your API through a code playground to create code in their language of choice and see if the code produces their desired results.

* Publish your developer portal anywhere
> Host language-specific documentation and SDKs on one domain where developers can experience your API or embed alongside existing documentation in your developer portal.

* Automate via CI/CD and CLI
> With full CI/CD integration across the API ecosystem, creating and maintaining a great DX is easier with continuous code generation. Any updates and changes will be published in seconds.

Let's take APImatic on a test drive.
