# Getting Started

APIMatic is a SaaS product and has a free trial. You can explore the capabilities and generete SDKs along with documentation to see what's possible.

## Signup
Start by [creating your APIMatic account](https://www.apimatic.io/account/register). When done, you'll be directed to APIMatic's dashboard.

## Import an API
From  APIMaticâ€™s dashboard you've got the option to create an API specification, use a Sample API or Import and existing API specification.

![APIMatic Dashboard Create API](/img/apimatic-dashboard-create-api.png)

Let's **import** the PetStore API spec with this URL.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apimatic/petstore/main/oas/petstore.yaml
```

Upon completing the import, you'll see a *Logging Summary* with details about the import. Clicking *proceed* triggers a validation of the API specification and  display of a *Validation Summary*. 

Each summary will list errors, warnings and messages to help you improve your API specification and get the best results from using APIMatic.

|         |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| Error   |  are serious issues with your specification that will prevent creation of SDKs. |
| Warning | are issues that won't prevent creation of SDK, but may result in missing features like tests or incomplete documentation. |
| Message |  are informational and will have minimal negative impact on SDKs and documentation. |

Now that you've successfully imported the [Petstore API specification](/docs/ways-to-build-sdks/code-generation/petstore-openapi.md), you have the option to generate a complete Developer Portal (which includes SDKs), or a Single SDK. 

:::info Using your own API specification
Importing your own API specification might return validation errors or warnings. This means your specification may need additional refinement to generate quality code. Reach out to [APIMatic's support team](https://www.apimatic.io/contact/) they can assist you in resolving issues so you can test a generated SDK with your own API.

In the next section, we'll generate a Developer Portal and TypeScript SDK along with it.
