Let's import the PetStore API spec with this URL.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apimatic/petstore/main/oas/petstore.yaml
```

Upon completing the import, you'll see a *Logging Summary* with details about the import. Clicking *proceed* triggers a validation of the API specification and then display a summary with Errors, Warnings and Messages.

|         |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| Error   |  are serious issues with your specification that will prevent creation of SDKs. |
| Warning | are issues that won't prevent creation of SDK, but may result in missing features like Tests or incomplete documentation. |
| Message |  are informational and will have minimal negative impact on SDKs and documentation. |



 import an API specification and generate a hosted developer portal along with SDKs in 6 languages (Typescript, Java, Python, PHP, C# and Ruby) with Go and Swift coming soon. SDKs and code samples generated by APIMatic are idiomatic and follow the popular coding style for each language. Code generation settings allow you to customize many aspects of SDKs.
