# Generate Documentation

You can generate a dev portal and SDKs together. We walk through that under [Generate a Portal & SDK](/docs/ways-to-build-sdks/code-generation/apimatic/generate-typescript-sdk.md).

The developer portal includes the following.

## API Reference

The developer portal has an API reference that includes:

* How authentication works 
* Displays base url 
* Explains methods and params 
* Example JSON response 
* Response headers 
* Models and properties 
* Enums allowed values
* Exceptions

## Language specific documentation


## API Playground


## Auto-generated tutorals

A step by step tutorial is generated and customized for each language SDK.  Screenshots are dynamically updated for your API. If you've published your SDKs, these tutorials are updated to include dependency instructions.




## Custom Markdown guides

If you don't like the default tutorial, you can turn it off and create additional pages with a built in Markdown or with a WYSIWYG editor.

Some simple branding is possible via APIMatic's dashbaord.  Changing the primary and link colors, selecting one of 5 available fonts, adding your logo to the homepage, etc. If you choose to embed the generated documentation in another site, you can add your own stylesheets to futher customize the branding.

You can select which language SDKs to offer and package publishing details.

Something we haven't touched on, you can include a download link for your API specification and the formats you'd like to offer.

Condensed code samples accompany each method and can be toggled to show a fully runnable code sample as well. Editing property values in the documentation updates code samples in real time. Toggle optional properties to add or remove them from code samples. All this functionality turns the documentation into an API playground of sorts. Add your API key to the documentation and make a live API call with the “Try it Out” button.
