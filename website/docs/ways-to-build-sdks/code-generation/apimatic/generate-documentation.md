# Generate Documentation

APIMatic’s developer portal includes API reference docs and language specific documentation. Each area includes a getting started guide, API endpoint methods, detailed model structures, enumerations and exceptions. You can create custom pages in markdown and insert those into the developer portal navigation as well.

APIMatic’s SDK documentation is really impressive. A step by step getting started guide is generated and customized for your API. Each API endpoint method is documented with parameters, headers and example JSON requests and responses. Condensed code samples accompany each method and can be toggled to show a fully runnable code sample as well. Editing property values in the documentation updates code samples in real time. Toggle optional properties to add or remove them from code samples. All this functionality turns the documentation into an API playground of sorts. Add your API key to the documentation and make a live API call with the “Try it Out” button.
