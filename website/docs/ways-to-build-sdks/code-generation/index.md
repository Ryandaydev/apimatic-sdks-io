The landscape of code generation tools is ever changing. At this time, we'll focus on OpenAPI Generator and APIMatic. Check back as we examine other code generators. 

:::info Other generators

These include [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen),  [AppWrite](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator), [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag) and [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest). If you have worked with other code generators and want to share your experience, start a conversation on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-sdks-io/discussions) and chat with us about becoming a contributor.

In order to use a code generator, you'll need a machine readable blueprint of your API. This is where API specifications come in.
