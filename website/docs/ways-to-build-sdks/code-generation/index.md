# Overview

Swagger and/or OpenAPI specifications are the foundation for code generation. These specifications act as a blueprint for describing an API in a machine readable format. They can be used to generate client-side SDKs, server-side stubs and documentation.

A simple rule for API specifications is “garbage in, garbage out”. The specification must accurately reflect the security, paths, parameters, requests, responses and schemas of the API developers will consume. Beyond accuracy, how tooling uses a specification will impact the quality of generated artifacts. For example, how you name components will impact a tool's ability to generate code with valid file names.
