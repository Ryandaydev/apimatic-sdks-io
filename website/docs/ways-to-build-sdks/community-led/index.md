# Overview
Developers love to show off their coding skills and popular APIs are a great opportunity to do this. They may start by solving their own problem (no SDK in their preferred language). Then to help others and receive help from the community, the developer may decide to open source their code on GitHub. Projects like this may gain momentum and be used by many of your developers. 


## üíñ Community Projects
I see these community led libraries as validation that developers find value in your API and want to support other developers using it. You might think, ‚Äúgreat, we don't need to invest in SDKs; our community will take care of it for us‚Äù. Don‚Äôt do this, for the simple reason. It‚Äôs not their job to build and maintain an important part of your developer experience. Unless you plan on negotiating compensation for their time, you won‚Äôt be in a position to control updates, additions or releases. 

Building your SDK strategy around libraries led by your developer community exclusively is not common. We surveyed over 50 companies with public APIs and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/libraries/#libraries) is the only one taking this approach.

## Both official and community
I don‚Äôt see it as an either or choice. Either you build all the SDKs or the community does. It‚Äôs really an ‚Äúand‚Äù opportunity. Your team can focus on delivering high quality SDKs in the languages most relevant to your target audience and if you feel comfortable designate space in your developer portal to promote popular community libraries. This is a great way to show appreciation for their work. It‚Äôs implicit that these projects are built by the community and support will come from the community, not your team. We see companies like [Box](https://developer.box.com/sdks-and-tools/), [Twilio SendGrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/libraries) and [EasyPost](https://www.easypost.com/docs/libraries)

## Community driven
You can introduce the concept of **company led but community driven** by open sourcing the SDKs built by your team. This provides an opportunity for developers to provide feedback and suggest ways to improve your SDKs in the form of issues and pull requests. You still control the roadmap and releases, but it‚Äôs informed by what‚Äôs most important to your developers.
