title: Industry Research on leading SDK Programs
description: A well-written API specification is essential for generating accurate and reliable SDK code. Here are some tips to help you write a clean, understandable, and maintainable specification.

We conducted a comprehensive survey of 53 organizations that offer SDKs to accompany their APIs to gain insight into the development process, supported programming languages, and other relevant factors.

## Industry Representation
The companies we examined covered a range of 18 industries, with the top five being:

* Communications
* Fintech
* Document Management
* Identity
* DevTools

## SDK Development Process
We analyzed public repositories and documentation to determine that 56% of SDKs were customized and created by internal teams. Furthermore, we discovered that 32% of businesses employed code generators as part of their SDK program. To track evolving patterns in SDK development, we plan to revisit these businesses in the future.

## SDK Automation Opportunities
With 32% of businesses employing code generators and 53% supplying a public API specification, 21% of companies have the possibility of automating SDK development. We've noticed a trend among businesses that provide API specifications and request developers to create their SDKs. This category accounted for 9% of the surveyed companies. Only one business elected not to offer official SDKs and instead encouraged community-driven SDK development.

 We anticipate that these findings will be useful to API companies  looking to enhance their SDK programs and developers seeking to create more efficient SDKs.

## SDK Breakdown

In our research, we analyzed 291 SDKs from 53 companies. What we discovered was fascinating.

From the oldest SDK, which was released in 2009, to the newest in 2022, we found that the average age of an SDK was a mere 5 years old! SDKs are in constant evolution, always improving and expanding their features to fit users' needs.

But what's even more interesting is the average number of releases, which was 51 over the lifespan of our SDKs. Taking our average age of 5 years, that's roughly 10 releases a year. I'm sure this varies between SDK programs and depends on how often APIs change and other factors.

We also found that 87% of these SDKs use semantic versioning, which make it easy for developers to understand changes in the code and quickly adapt to them.

But perhaps the most exciting part of our survey was discovering the vast array of programming languages that these SDKs support. With 18 languages represented, we found that Java was the most popular, followed closely by Python and Ruby. And with JavaScript and PHP tied for fourth place, CSharp barely edged out GoLang for the 5th position in our programming language list.
