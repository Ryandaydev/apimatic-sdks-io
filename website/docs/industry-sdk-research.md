title: Industry Research on leading SDK Programs
description: A well-written API specification is essential for generating accurate and reliable SDK code. Here are some tips to help you write a clean, understandable, and maintainable specification.

We performed a quantitative survey of 53 companies who offer SDKs for use with their APIs to learn how SDKs are built, the programming languages being supported and other insights.

## Companies

Companies spanned 18 industries with the top five being

* Communications
* Fintech
* Document Management
* Identity
* DevTools

Looking at public repositories and documentation we determined that 56% of SDKs are bespoke and homegrown by internal teams. We found that 32% of companies were using code generators as part of their SDK program. We plan to revisit these companies in the future to observe any changes or trends around how SDKs are being built.

With 32% of companies using code generators and 53% providing a public API specification, that leaves 21% with the opportunity to automate SDK development.

An emerging trend is companies choosing to provide and API specification and ask developers to generate their own SDKs. That represented 9% of the companies surveyed. Only one company choose to not offer any official SDKs and instead is promoting community led SDKs.

## SDKs

The 53 companies we looked at have a combine 291 SDKs. A few insights we gathered about these SDK programs.

* Oldest SDK was first released in 2009
* Newest SDK was first released in 2022
* Average age of an SDK is 5 years old
* Average total number of releases is 51
* 87% use semantic versions

A total of 18 programming languages represented in our SDK survey. The most popular language was Java, followed by Python, Ruby. Tied for 4th place was JavaScript and PHP, while CSharp barely edged out GoLang.
