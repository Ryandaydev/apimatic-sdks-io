![API complexity vs Product Application](/img/logo-3d.svg#logo) 

SDKs (Software Development Kits) are an essential part of the developer experience, providing developers with a convenient and user-friendly way to interact with APIs. SDKs abstract away complexity and reduce the amount of code needed to perform common tasks. Despite their importance, SDKs can be difficult to build and maintain in multiple languages. Without established standards, teams are left to make decisions with incomplete information around what developers want and the features other companies are including in their SDKs. 

SDKs.io aims to improve the state of SDK development by offering a compilation of recommended practices for creating and utilizing SDKs. This resource covers subjects such as design and support, as well as guidelines for constructing top-notch SDKs, offering developers the knowledge they need to make well-informed choices and produce exceptional software.






Our team at [APIMatic](https://www.apimatic.io/) have a lot of expereince building SDKs for APIs and want to share it with you. Throughout the site we share our opinion on a range of topics informed by our experiences. 

We don't have all the answers and invite you to share your thoughts with us. Reach out to me, [Sid Maestre](mailto:sid.maestre@apimatic.io), VP of Developer Relations or the APIMatic team on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/APIMatic). We want to hear your stories and include them on SDKs.io.
