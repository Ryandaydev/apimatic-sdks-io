# What is an SDK

SDKs, software development kits, provide developers the code necessary to interact with an  underlying system (often APIs). SDKs are sometimes viewed as just code libraries, but the term “kit” implies more. SDKs do include code libraries, but they also have relevant documentation, code samples, developer guides, additional tools (i.e. compiler, debuggers, etc) and other supplementary materials. SDKs won’t build your API integration for you, instead they provide building blocks to accelerate development.

You can compare SDKs to a lego set with all the parts you need and step by step assembly instructions. This is a fair analogy, as SDKs are purpose built with the parts and supporting materials to help you complete a task. SDKs help developers with standard operations, so they can focus on the business logic and features unique to their application.
