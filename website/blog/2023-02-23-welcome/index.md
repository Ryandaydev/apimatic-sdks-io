Our goal is to build a [community of practice](https://www.communityofpractice.ca/background/what-is-a-community-of-practice/) around SDK development.

Want to contribute a guest blog post about your SDK development experience?

Head over to [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-sdks-io/discussions) to start the conversation with our team and tell us how you'd like to contribute.
